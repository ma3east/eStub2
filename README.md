# eStub2
###eStub built with NodeJs and AngularJs

Will be using this project to rebuild my second project from GA WDI eStub, instead of using Rails, will attempt to build and improve using NodeJs and most likely AngularJs.

Why?  To get more practise with Node and Angular and my developing skills, and because i didn't implement all the features i would have liked to in version 1.0

Note: Am using bower-installer to install front-end files, if main file not found via bower-install then user bower.

Also using Grunt, and setup to run grunt tasks and node server at the same time.
See <a href="https://scotch.io/" target="_blank">scotch.io</a> for useful tutorials on setting these up if structure is not clear.
